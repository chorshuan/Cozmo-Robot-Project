# Cozmo-Robot-Project
These codelab codes were done by myself and my group members (Heng Li En, Lim Mei Tian & Jeremy Chong).
The purpose of the project was to create multiple tasks for Cozmo with the help of all the functions that codelab has. This was our
final project which was graded for our PFP IT Application module at Nanyang Polytechnic.

All the codelab files require the cozmo app in order to view the codes and edit them.
